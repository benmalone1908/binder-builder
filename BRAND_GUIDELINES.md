# Bindered — Brand Guidelines (v1)

These guidelines define the visual and tonal identity of the Bindered app.
All UI updates must conform to this document.

Bindered is a functional, checklist-first tool for card collectors.
The brand should feel **calm, organized, and trustworthy**, not flashy or hype-driven.

---

## 1. Brand Personality

Bindered should feel:
- Practical
- Collector-built
- Completion-focused
- Calm and organized
- Spreadsheet-adjacent (but better)

Bindered should NOT feel:
- Loud
- Salesy
- Investment-focused
- Crypto/fintech-like
- Gamified or gimmicky

Tone keywords:
- "clear"
- "organized"
- "quietly satisfying"
- "built for collectors"

---

## 2. Logo Usage

### Primary Logo
- Vector-style binder with card sleeves icon
- Wordmark: "Bindered"
- Used in:
  - app header
  - landing page
  - onboarding

### Icon-Only Logo
- Binder + cards icon only
- Used for:
  - app icon
  - favicon
  - loading states
  - mobile navigation

### Rules
- Do not place the logo on busy backgrounds
- Always maintain sufficient padding
- Do not add shadows, gradients, or effects to the logo
- Do not recolor outside approved palette

## 3. Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Navy Blue (Primary)**
  - Hex: `#0F2A44`
  - Use for:
    - headers
    - primary navigation
    - primary buttons
    - key UI accents

- **Deep Blue (Secondary)**
  - Hex: `#1F4E79`
  - Use for:
    - hover states
    - secondary actions
    - icons
    - links

### Accent Color
- **Warm Orange**
  - Hex: `#F97316`
  - Use sparingly for:
    - completion indicators
    - "owned" state
    - progress bars
    - primary CTA emphasis

Accent color should never dominate the UI.

## 4. Typography

### Primary Font
- **Inter**
- Used for:
  - all UI text
  - tables
  - forms
  - buttons

Inter is preferred for its clarity, spacing, and numeral legibility.

### Font Rules
- Avoid decorative fonts in the app UI
- Use consistent font sizes
- Prioritize readability over personality
- Tables must remain dense and scannable

---

## 5. UI Design Principles

### General
- Prefer flat design
- Avoid heavy shadows
- Avoid unnecessary animation
- Favor clarity over visual flair

### Layout
- Desktop-first
- Clear content hierarchy
- Consistent spacing
- Minimal visual noise

### Navigation
- Calm and predictable
- No hidden gestures
- No surprise interactions

---

## 6. Tables (Critical Component)

Tables are the core UI of Bindered.

### Table Requirements
- High density without feeling cramped
- Clear row separation
- Sticky headers if possible
- Card numbers and player names must be easy to scan

### Status Representation
Statuses:
- `missing`
- `pending`
- `owned`

Visual treatment:
- Missing: neutral text
- Pending: subtle indicator (outline or muted color)
- Owned: accent color (orange) used sparingly

Do NOT:
- Use bright green/red
- Use icons that overpower text
- Animate status changes excessively

---

## 7. Buttons & Actions

### Primary Actions
- "New Set"
- "Import Checklist"
- "Save"

Primary actions:
- Navy background
- White text
- Subtle hover state

### Secondary Actions
- Edit
- Cancel
- Export

Secondary actions:
- Neutral background
- Dark text
- Clear affordances

Avoid:
- Destructive red buttons unless absolutely necessary
- Overusing accent color for non-critical actions

---

## 8. Language & Copy Tone

### Voice
- Clear
- Direct
- Neutral
- Collector-first

### Examples
Good:
- "Import checklist"
- "Mark as owned"
- "Cards remaining"

Avoid:
- "Level up"
- "Unlock"
- "Crush your collection"
- "Power features"

Bindered should never sound like a game or an investment platform.

---

## 9. Success Criteria for UI Updates

A UI change is successful if:
- It reduces cognitive load
- It makes checklist progress easier to understand
- It feels calmer than before
- It does not introduce visual clutter

If unsure, choose the simpler option.

## 10. Guiding Principle

Bindered exists to help collectors finish sets with less friction.

Every design decision should support:
- clarity
- organization
- progress visibility
